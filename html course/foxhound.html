 <h1>Foxhounds</h1> 
        
    <h5><u>Sunny</u></h5>
        <p>Sunny is a 14 year old Foxhound who was rescued by a family with 2 small children. It is unknown what kind of life she had before this family rescued her. She was kept in a cage virtually all of the time by this family & was either ignored or picked on by the children. </p>

        <p>One of my family members saw what was happening to Sunny & rescued her from the <em>"rescuers"</em> on a trial basis.</p>
    
        <p>As you have probably figured out, Sunny remained with our family!</p>
        
        <p>It is noted below that foxhounds are not good watchdogs.  That is not the case with Sunny.  She is very protective of her owner & is a great watchdog! (This is probably because she was rescued from a dismal existence with the prior rescuers.) She is a very happy dog who is always smiling.</p>

    <h5><u>Foxhounds</u></h5>
        <p>Foxhounds are a medium sized dog. These are the different types of Foxhounds:
            <ul>
                <li>American Foxhound</li>
                <li>Dumfriesshire Black & Tan Foxhound (now extinct)</li>
                <li>English Foxhound</li>
                <li>Welsh Foxhound</li>
                <li>Penn-Marydel Foxhound</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <p>Foxhounds generally have a very docile & sweet disposition.  They are easy going & get along well with children & other animals & enjoy human companionship.  Foxhounds are very independent & like to follow a scent.  As such, they cannot always be trusted off leash. One of the websites I researched said that foxhounds do not make good watchdogs.</p>
    
        <p>Foxhounds can weigh from 65 to 70 lbs for the males & 60 to 65 lbs for the females. They have a short coat that is usually black, orange & white in color. The lifespan of a foxhound is approximately 10 to 13 years.</p>
