    <!-- About Bailey -->    
    <h5><u>Bailey</u></h5>
        <p>Bailey is a 4 year old king shepherd who lives with some of my family members.  She is a beautiful, very energetic dog.  She must still have some of her puppy in her.  She loves to play in the backyard & chase a ball as long as you are willing to toss it for her to catch. Bailey is a very intelligent, obedient dog & was extremely easy to train. She loves her owners & follows them everywhere.</p>  
        
        <p>Bailey gets along well with & loves to play with other dogs. She will run around the yard while the other dogs try to catch her.  Good luck to them trying to catch her because Bailey is very fast!</p>
  
    <!-- About King Shepherds -->
    <h5><u>King Shepherds</u></h5>    
        <p>King Shepherds are a medium to large breed of dog & are somewhere between the size of the Newfoundland and the Foxhound. They are a mixed breed of the German Shepherd & the Shiloh Shepherd.  As such they are not officially recognized by the Kennel Clubs.</p>
        
        <p>King Shepherds have temperate, adaptable personalities & are better suited for single family homes with a fenced backyard because of their high energy needs. Male & female shepherds can weigh from 130 to 150 pounds & 90 to 110 pounds respectively. </p>
        
        <p>These dogs have thick, double coats & can require a lot of brushing to help cut down on the amount of shedding they do. King Shepherds are highly intelligent which makes them really easy to train.</p>
        
        <p> Like the Newfoundland they are prone to hip dysplasia so it is a good idea to keep an eye on their weight so as not to put too much strain on their hips. Other health issues include Von Willebrand's disease (genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot) & hypothyroidism (reduces the dog's metabolic rate, may result in obesity, canine diabetes or heart disease).</p>
        
        <p>The pros & cons of the King Shepherd are:</p>
