<!-- About my other family members -->
        <p>My other family members include:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Tony, a mixed breed dog</li>
            <li>Jeannie, a toy poodle</li>
            <li>Abby, a golden doodle</li>
            <li>Jaygee, a calico pussycat</li>
            <li>Princess Jan, Buddy & Socks, gray & white kitties</li>
        </ul>
    
<!-- About Tony -->
    <h5><u>Tony</u></h5>  
         <p>Tony was a stray mixed breed dog trying to survive on the streets of Mexico.  One day he stole a cake from a store & the owner sliced his face open as punishment. He was saved by a rescue organization in that country where he was stitched up & nursed back to health.</p> 

        <p>Tony was later sent to a rescue organization in Canada.  From there, one of my family members brought him home "<em>on a trial basis</em>". Of course, once they spent some time with him, they could not give him back & they adopted him.</p> 

        <p>Tony is now a happy, healthy dog in his new home where he lives with Princess Jan, Buddy & Socks the pussycats.  He is such a good dog & is always smiling!!</p>
   
    <!-- About Jeannie & Abby -->
    <h5><u>Jeannie & Abby</u></h5>

        <p>A video of Jeannie & Abby playing</p>
    
        <p>Jeannie is a 15 year old toy poodle & Abby is a 3 year old golden doodle. They reside in the same household with some of my family members.  Both dogs were chosen because they are less likely to affect anyone with allergic reactions to dogs.</p>

        <p>Both toy poodles & golden doodles are small dogs. At least our golden doodle is a small dog. I imagine that if they had more of the golden retriever in them, they could be larger. Jeannie is, of course, less active than Abby because of her age.  Abby is very energetic.  She will chase a ball or other toy as long as anyone is willing to throw it. They are both treated like little princesses & are extremely happy in their home.</p>
        
    <!-- About Jaygee the pussycat --> 
    <h5><u>Jaygee the pussycat</u></h5>    
        <p>Jaygee is a 12 year old calico pussycat who lives in our home with Sally, our 8 year old newfoundland. Jaygee is not a fan of other cats & does not get along with them very well.  She does, however, get along well with dogs, dogs that live in our house that is. Jaygee is a one-person pussycat & does not really like anyone else who comes into our home.</p>

     <h5><u>Calico cats</u></h5>   
        <p>Calico cats come in any breed of cat & have a tri-color coats made up of white, orange & black. White is the predominant color. They are almost exclusively female & if they are males, they are usually sterile. Since October 2001, the calico cat has been the state cat of Maryland in the United States because their color resembles the color of the baltimore oriole, their state bird.</p>

        <p>Folklore has it that calico cats are supposed to <em>"bring good luck"</em> in many cultures. Apparently in the United States they are sometimes referred to as <em>"money cats"</em>. It looks like the <em>"money cats"</em> is a thing in the states.  I have not seen any evidence of that here in Canada.</p>
