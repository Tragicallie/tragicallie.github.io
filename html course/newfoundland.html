    <!-- About Sally -->
    <h5><u>Sally</u></h5>
        <p>Sally is an 8 year old black & white Landseer newfoundland. She lives in our house with Jaygee the pussycat. She is an awesome dog! She is extremely loyal & protective. Sally is a great <em>"burglar alarm"</em>.  She lets us know whenever anyone is at or near the house.  She is extremely vocal if someone comes to the door. It is interesting to watch people stepping back on the sidewalk away from the door when they hear her barking.</p>
   
    <!-- About Bob & Marley -->
    <h5><u>Bob & Marley</u></h5>     
        <p>Bob is a 10 year old black newfoundland.  Marley is a 14 year old black newfoundland. They reside in the same household with some of my family members & with Chewie the pussycat. Bob & Marley are great dogs & are very loyal & protective of their owners. Visitors, aside from family & friends, are often intimidated by their size.</p>
    
    <!-- About Newfoundlands -->
    <h5><u>Newfoundlands</u></h5>    
        <p>Newfoundlands are a large breed of dog. </p>
        
        <p>They are either black, brown, gray or white & black. In Canada, only the black or black & white newfoundlands are recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club.</p>

        <p>Newfoundlands are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength, calm dispositions & loyalty. Because of their muscular build, thick water resistent double coat, swimming abilities & webbed paws, they excel at water rescue & lifesaving.  Originally they were bred as working dogs for fisherman.</p>

        <p>Newfoundlands have a huge lung capacity which enables them to swim long distances.  Their thick oily waterproof coat gives them protection from the chilly, icy waters.</p>

        <p>These dogs have a calm, docile manner, are very strong & extremely loyal. Newfoundlands are very good with children & other animals & are a great companion for people in therapy. </p>

        <p>On the downside, Newfoundlands are prone to hip dysplasia so it is a good idea to keep an eye on their weight so as not to put too much strain on their hips. Other health issues could include elbow dysplasia, cystinurin (calculi stones form in the bladder), defective heart valves. Newfoundlands lifespan is 8 to 10 years but they can live to be 15 years old. </p>
